# Examples
This section contains examples and sample files to help you get acquainted with the FEM-Design API via C#, Grasshopper or Python.

## Running the example files

### üë©‚Äçüíª C#
To properly run the C# examples, we recommend that you clone the entirety of the FEM-Design API repository with Git. You can find instructions for this [here](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone). You can also download the entire repository as a .zip file and unpack it on your computer.

The examples are then found in the femdesign-api/FemDesign.Samples/C# folder. Open the `FemDesign.Samples.csproj` file. Within the project, the `Main.cs` file is used to run any files or examples - simply `//` comment to hide scripts from running, and leave one open to run it.

### ü¶ó Grasshopper
The Grasshopper examples can be run without cloning the repository - all you need is to install the package, instructions for this can be found on the main page. Once installed, you can download any of the files in the femdesign-api/FemDesign.Samples/Grasshopper folder and open them in Grasshopper.

The examples are ready to run out-of-the-box, but you might have to set a file path or file name. You'll know either from instructions in the file, or because some components are orange or red.

### ü§ñ Dynamo

### üêç Python
The python example folder contains an example (`using_pythonnet.py`) on how to run the C# (`FemDesign.Core`) API from Python. This example uses the python package Python.NET (clr) (http://pythonnet.github.io/).

**NOTE**: A complete Python wrapper is [planned in the future](https://github.com/strusoft/femdesign-api/issues/221), but pythonnet can be used already today to access all of the functionality of the C# API.

The example have been tested using
- IronPython 2.7 (pythonnet pre-installed)
- CPython 3.7 (with [pip package pythonnet](https://pypi.org/project/pythonnet/))

### üêâ Python-old-examples
The Python-old-examples is an API wrapper with different call functions to make it easier to create the struxml-model and run the analysis. Please see a detailed description in the documentation below.
