# Examples
This section contains examples and sample files to help you get acquainted with the FEM-Design API via C#, Grasshopper or Python.

## Running the example files

### üë©‚Äçüíª C#
To properly run the C# examples, we recommend that you clone the entirety of the FEM-Design API repository with Git. You can find instructions for this [here](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone). You can also download the entire repository as a .zip file and unpack it on your computer.

The examples are then found in the femdesign-api/FemDesign.Samples/C# folder. Open the `FemDesign.Samples.csproj` file. Within the project, the `Main.cs` file is used to run any files or examples - simply `//` comment to hide scripts from running, and leave one open to run it.

### ü¶ó Grasshopper
The Grasshopper examples can be run without cloning the repository - all you need is to install the package, instructions for this can be found on the main page. Once installed, you can download any of the files in the femdesign-api/FemDesign.Samples/Grasshopper folder and open them in Grasshopper.

The examples are ready to run out-of-the-box, but you might have to set a file path or file name. You'll know either from instructions in the file, or because some components are orange or red.
